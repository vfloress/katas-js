# Welcome to the Kata sessions

Today I present to you the following exercise: **Sales Commissions**

## Sales Commissions

### Description

You're a regional manager for an office beverage sales company, and right now you're in charge of paying your sales team
monthly commissions.

Sales people get paid using the following formula for the total commission: commission is 6.2% of profit, with no
commission for any product to total less than zero.

### Input

You'll be given two matrices showing the sales figure per salesperson for each product they sold, and the expenses by
product per salesperson. Example:
```
    Revenue 
    
            Frank   Jane
    Tea       120    145
    Coffee    243    265
    
    Expenses
    
            Frank   Jane
    Tea       130     59
    Coffee    143    198
```

### Output

Your program should calculate the commission for each salesperson for the month. Example:

```
                    Frank   Jane
    Commission       6.20   9.49
```
