# Welcome to the Kata sessions

Today I present to you the following exercise: **Bank account** by Sandro Mancuso

Your bank is tired of its mainframe COBOL accounting software, and they hired you for a greenfield project in - what a happy coincidence
- your favorite programming language!

### Instructions
Write a class named Account that implements the following public interface:
```
public interface AccountService {
    void deposit(int amount)
    void withdraw(int amount)
    void printStatement()
}
```
### Rules
You cannot change the public interface of this class.

### Scenario
Here's the specification for an acceptance test that expresses the desired behaviour for this
```
Given a client makes a deposit of 1000 on 10-01-2012
And a deposit of 2000 on 13-01-2012
And a withdrawal of 500 on 14-01-2012
When they print their bank statement
Then they would see:

Date       || Amount || Balance
14/01/2012 || -500   || 2500
13/01/2012 || 2000   || 3000
10/01/2012 || 1000   || 1000
```
